Can I use

{ 
use seq;
...
}

to mean

seq {

}

I see the problem: a seq means that all statements in a block are seq
But what I want is the ability to say that a for loop can be unrolled,
or not.

So, in Gannet-C, 

    for () seq {} 

does not express that! 

OTOH, there is actually no need to indicate that a loop can't be unrolled.

question is what 

use seq qw<do> means. Guess it is the same as 


do {
use seq;

};

So in short, use seq/no seq is enough!
