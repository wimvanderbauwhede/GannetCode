Download Gannet
---------------

The current status of Gannet is _alpha_. See the [Roadmap](#roadmap) for schedule and features of planned releases. 

### Requirements

Gannet runs on POSIX (unix-like) platforms. It has been tested on Linux and Mac OS X. 

For prerequisites and installation instructions, see [Installing and building Gannet](docs.html) or INSTALL.

### Distributions

#### Gannet Live Distro as VirtualBox HardDisk 

This is a complete Linux distro (Mandriva One) with all tools required for Gannet pre-installed. Simply get [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org) and run the Gannet Live Distro in a Linux VM.

(unpack with `tar -jxvf GannetLive.tbz2`)

#### Full Gannet Distribution

Contains the compiler, assembler, disassembler, runtime libraries, Ruby reference model, C++ virtual machine and SystemC model as well as documentation and examples.

#### Virtual Machine Distribution

For those who want to develop, port or simply try out the VM without writing and compiling Gannet code. Contains the C++ virtual machine and its Ruby reference model as well as documentation and precompiled examples.

#### SystemC Hardware Model Distribution

For those who want to develop, port or simply try out the Gannet SystemC hardware model without writing and compiling Gannet code. Contains the SystemC model and its Ruby reference model as well as documentation and precompiled examples.

[GannetSoC-pre-alpha.tgz](downloads/GannetSoC-pre-alpha.tgz)

#### Compiler Distribution

For those interested in the Gannet language and the compiler, but not in the VM or the hardware model. Contains the compiler and runtime libraries, the
assembler and disassembler.

### Roadmap<a name="roadmap"></a>

The plan is to release a new version every 6 months, with minor version releases for critical bug fixes every 3 months.

* The _alpha_ release is the first "official" Gannet release. At this stage Gannet is usable for playing around with, development and testing.

* The _beta_ release will be mainly a bug fix release, with few additional features (the most notable feature is the planned inclusion of a SystemC model for the Quarc Network-on-Chip).

* The _1.0_ release will feature a Virtual Machine able to run on an embedded processor without intermediate operating system.

* The _2.0_ release's key feature will be _Gannet-C_, a high-level language for programming Gannet

* The _3.0_ release will feature _HDL code_ for the Gannet SoC
