p&P's Web Site System

=== Overview ===
3 levels:
- components
- subcomponents
- elements

* Components
Components are the basic building blocks of the site: banner, top navigation, content, etc.

At CSS level, components are implemented as divs.

* Subcomponents
Subcomponents are the logical building blocks which make up the components: site name, baseline, logo, etc.

At CSS level, subcomponents are implemented as classes or ids.

* Elements
Elements are structural elements such as paragraphs, lists, etc. 

Note: For float-based sites we need an extra level of float containers.
