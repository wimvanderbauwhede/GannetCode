### About Gannet

Gannet is the research project of [Wim Vanderbauwhede](http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~wim/). It is funded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council ([EPSRC](http://www.epsrc.ac.uk)) as an Advanced Research Fellowship.

The name Gannet does not stands for anything in particular, but it does refer to the elegant [seabird](http://www.rspb.org.uk/wildlife/birdguide/name/g/gannet/) that can be seen off the coast of Scotland.
