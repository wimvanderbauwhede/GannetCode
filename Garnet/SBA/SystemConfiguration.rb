WV04122008: Multi-threaded cores provided by multiple service cores

Every service can have multiple aliases, and we can assign every alias to a particular thread
That means that the ServiceManager must have a (small) lookup table to know which tid can support
which alias. The K_S:Name provides the opcode, the lookup provides the tid. 

* The first complication is that we can have multiple tids per opcode
So knowing the opcode, the lookup would return a list of tids. On the other hand, we have the list
of free tids. What we need is rather a tid mask than an actual tid, 
i.e. a single bitmask should give the complete range

plus 0,1,2,3 => 00001111
minus
times
over 4 => 00010000
gt 5 => 00100000
lt
eq
not => 11000000

Then we take the table of tids and their status:

0 1
1 1
2 0
3 1
4 1
5 0
6 1
7 0

and we AND this with the mask. So for plus we get:

0 1
1 1

and we simply take the smallest tid

* The second complication is that a some opcodes can be supplied by different Service Cores than others
This means that we can, alas, not simply have

7 => [ls_ALU,19,'ALU'],

Suppost we have the following situation:

7 => [
        'ALU1': [ls_ALU1,17]
        'ALU2': [ls_ALU2,17]
     ]

This service has 4 opcodes plus,minus,times,over;
2 of these are provided by ls_ALU1, the other 2 by ls_ALU2

alu:plus (+)
alu:minus (-)
alu:times (*)
alu:over (/)

So we could do:

    plus: [ALU1, [0, 1, 2, 3], 9] # Every alias needs a number!
    minus: [ALU1, [0, 1, 2, 3], 10]
    times: [ALU2, [0, 1, 2, 3], 11]
    over: [ALU2, [4, 5], 12]

For the compiler, "+" would resolve to alu:plus, opcode 9; looking up 'alu:plus' gives ALU1, that gives 7
We now need to give ALU1 and ALU2 the list of tids on which they can run, so the YAML gets an extra field:

7 => [ls_ALU1,17,'ALU1',[0,1]]
7 => [ls_ALU2,17,'ALU2',[2,3]]

For simplicity, we could add a field for NCORE_THREADS, so we would have

7 => [SBA_SCLib.method(:ls_ALU1),17,'ALU1',4,[0,1]]

But of course we could simply ask for the length of the list (at least in Ruby)



Another use case is this:

42 => [cs_S42,42,'S42',[0,1,2,3]]
42 => [cs_IF,42,'S42_IF',[4,5]]
42 => [cs_ALU,42,'S42_ALU',[6,7]]

The code will contain:

S42 => will resolve to 42 as the service id; I think the opcode should actually be 0 or 1
'S42:return': [S42_IF,[4],0]
'S42:if': [S42_IF,[5],1]
'S42:plus': [S42_ALU,[6],0]
'S42:eq': [S42_ALU,[7],1]

(There is some redundancy here and some room for errors here, maybe we should not detail the tid for each alias?)

At compile time, S42:plus (might be 'S42+') will be looked up as an alias, it gets the opcode 0 

=> not right: how can we know the tid? so the K_S would now need the tid!

Threads/opcodes/aliases

- the default opcode is 0, the default thread is 0
- the SBA.yml entry is extended to include:
    - the tid
    - number of threads for that tid
    - maybe total number of threads? No
    - the order in the SBA.yml file determines the actual tid; so tid+nthreads is transformed into the mask
    
- the aliases entry contains the tid. I think at the moment number of threads is not controlled at level of aliases.
IN fact, the alias refers to the service name, so maybe the tid is not required.
- aliases have opcodes 

    3: [ls_LET, 6, LET, 0, 4]
    
- I think either we have no aliases and then the opcode is 0 or we do have aliases and then the opcode must be explicit.
In other words LET needs an entry in the Aliases with opcode 0

For multiple service core we get something like

    42: [cs_S42, 42, S42,0,2]
    42: [cs_IF, 42,S42_IF,1,1]
    42: [cs_ALU, 42,S42_ALU,2,1]
    
Aliases:
    'S42:if': [S42_IF, 1, 0]
    'S42:return': [S42_IF, 1, 1]
    'S42:plus': [S42_ALU, 2,0]
    'S42:lessthan': [S42_ALU, 2,1]


The K_S:Name field now gets the "tid" as an extra field. This is not the actual thread id but rather the id of the core providing the service. We limit NCORE_THREADS to 8 so 3 bits will do. Leaves 5 bits for the opcodes.
Note that now non-threaded, non-aliased services have a scid and opcode of 0. For non-threaded services, it is sufficient to take Name & F_Opcode (5 bits); the complement is (Name & F_SCId) >> FS_SCId
