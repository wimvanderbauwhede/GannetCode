The model for calling Perl from Gannet:

- a "new" creates a new interpreter which runs a script which creates an object

- a method call takes either no arguments, an int or a list of ints
-> How do I know which? Based on the Gannet arglist 

- It should return a list of ints, or at least a list of Words.

- The main question is: how to prevent the interpreter from exiting after it runs the "creator" script? Maybe it is like an interactive interpreter: it only exits when you explicitly tell it to.

So basically, we 
1/ get the arg addresses
2/ get the args, which are Word_Lists
3/ Problem: a Word_List can be anything, how do I know what it is?
It's like this: if it is "data", we don't need to know
if it is to be symbolised, we'll need to know
I think I'll have to supply a serialise/deserialise API
Or can we use Freeze/Thaw?

- We definitely need symbol/unsymbol calls to interface between the
objects and built-in functions. I think it would be best to give them
type information: (symbol 'int (...)) (unsymbol 'string (...))
- That practically means we need to use the 64-bit version as 
we need to have this type info in the symbol.
