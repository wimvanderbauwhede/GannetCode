TODO for quick-win Gannet-Perl

Goal: allow early testing on multicore system

Requires:
1. Perl-to-Gannet minimal
Is furthest advanced, we can already run some trivial scripts

2. Automatic generation of SBA.yml
- use SBA.yml template with all control services
- get the interfaces
- create service instances

3. Automatic generation of C++-readable service opcode list based on SBA.yml
- All we need is a list like this:
ninstances
service instance id 1
nmethods
opcode1 method1
opcode2 method2
...
service instance id 1
nmethods 
opcode1 method1
opcode2 method2
...

We could actually generate these with a Perl script ...

4. Embedding Perl in Gannet via libperl++
https://github.com/Leont/libperl

5. POSIX threads or (better) MPI calls
- we need these anyway, can do this on work time!
