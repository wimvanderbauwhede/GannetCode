TODO for Gannet-Perl 22/12/2010

A very long TODO list ...

Compiler
--------
* PerlParser.hs
    - fix opupdate expressions
    - add support for file handles of the form my $FH and <$FH>
* TypeMapper.hs
    - perform type inference to at least distinguish between float, int and string
    - continue work on determining compile-time computable constructs. Means a lot of extra plumbing
* Emitter.hs
    - emit correct calls to ALU, FPU or String based on the types
    - emit "null" assignments for variable declarations
    - use CTC evaluation. Very difficult
* Generate the Perl.SBA.yml file entries for the Perl objects
* Generate the configuration info to be read by the VM (i.e. the mapping of opcodes to methods for the Perl object wrappers)

* Perl allows variable assignments inside function arguments. This complicates scoping somewhat: e.g.

while ( defined( my $line=<$FH> ) ) {...} should put $line in the scope of the while block.

That means I can't simply stow arguments as in a function definition or for-loop, instead for every assignment
I must determine if it needs to be stowed or not ...

* Numerify filehandles

Runtime
-------
* ServiceCoreLibrary.rb
    - add all Perl-specific Services
    - make them translatable to C++
    - add support in ls_LET for sending MM packets to clean up Array, Hash etc
* ServiceManager.rb
    - add support for MM packets, i.e. to deallocate memory
* Embed Perl
* Add support to read the configurations for the Perl objects from file
