To add e.g. the LookupTable or Request or in general add a module to Gannet-SystemC:

* Create a wrapper around the original type in its own SC_*.h file
* Create the interface in SC_SBA_Interfaces.h
* Create the specialised ports in SC_SBA_Spec_Ports.h
* Create the arbiter in its own SC_*_Arbiter.h file if required
* Add the class to SC_SBA.h
* Wire up

The architecture is as follows: every SC_*.h file inherits from SC_*_if and instantiates one or more exports
sc_export<SC_*_if >
These exports have a corresponding specialised port port_SC_*_if used in modules that connect to it

For a good example see SC_Subtask_list.h.
