scsrc/ contains SystemC wrappers around core code generated from Ruby/C++ with the SYSC flag set to on. This code is as close to the original Ruby code as
possible.
gensrc/ contains generated C++ files used as sources for the cores of the SystemC models. A script in gensrc/ (split_sc_module_src.pl) splits these sources into
their building blocks.

src/ contains SystemC versions of all components of the SBA. This folder is obsolete!
