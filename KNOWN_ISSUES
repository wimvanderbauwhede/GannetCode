Known Issues for Gannet release 0.1

LAMBDA:

(let
 	(assign 'f (lambda ...))
	(apply (read 'f) ...)
)

does not work as the read call will fail because it's non-blocking. Instead, use either

(let
 	(assign 'f (lambda ...))
	'(apply (read 'f) ...)
)

or

 (let
 	'(assign 'f (lambda ...))
	'(apply (read 'f) ...)
)
or

(let
 	(assign 'f (lambda ...))
	(apply f ...)
)
